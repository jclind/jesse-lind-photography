# Jesse Lind's Photography Portfolio
This page is my personal photography portfolio website. I've always been facinated with photography and capturing a moment, and over the years I've taken some pictures that I think are worthy of sharing, but I wanted to have more freedom in displaying my work beyond an instagram account. So I decided to make my own photography website.
